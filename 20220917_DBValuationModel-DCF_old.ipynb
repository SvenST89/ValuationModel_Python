    "Before starting the analysis we need some general assumptions and information on data in order to implement the DCF method for company valuation. We need the _after-tax cost of debt_ for the specific company as well as the _cost of its equity_. As for the debt it is quite cumbersome to get the individual firm´s cost of debt - either we would need to check the annual reports of that company or be lucky and find a free platform that offers such an information for any possible company. Both methods are difficult to implement in a dynamic and automated manner within a python script; I would need to build an extra scraper just to retrieve such an information for any possible firm. And I barely believe that there is a free source for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u><h4><font color=\"#ab4e52\">Cost of Debt Estimate</font></h4></u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, I will **use the [central bank information on interest rates](https://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/browse.do?node=bbn2883) of new loans (>1 EURm) for non-financial corporations** and retrieve interest rate time series data from the `ECB SDM 2.1 RESTful web service` through making a **http get request**. Basically, it is like a function replicating the [sdw_api python package from the ECB](https://pypi.org/project/sdw-api/), but is more flexible in the sense that it does not throw an error for the retrieved data if different time series are imported, which was the case for the api package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard entrypoint for the **ECB SDMX 2.1 RESTful web service** is `https://sdw-wsrest.ecb.europa.eu/service/data/`.<br>\n",
    "We then make an empty list in which we will store each individual dataframe which we will have received from the https get request on basis of the time series keys in 'keys_list'. Specifically, I will use the **key 'MIR.M.U2.B.A2A.O.R.1.2240.EUR.N'** which identifies the data on `Bank interest rates - loans to corporations of over EUR 1M with an IRF period of over five & up to ten years (new business) - euro area`. Nonetheless, I will write a function that is general enough to iterate across a list of keys and get an average estimate of the interest rate level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the function `get_ir_data()` is general enough in order to retrieve ECB data for any key in the `key_list` (e.g. also keys for the yield curve or exchange rates).\n",
    "\n",
    "<u><h4><font color=\"#ab4e52\">Cost of Equity Estimate</font></h4></u>\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the cost of equity I will follow the <span style=\"color:orange\"><b>CAPM Approach</b></span>, i.e. use the current ECB interest rate for main refinancing operations (1.25%, 2022/09/17) as **risk-free rate** and calculate the **annualized market risk premium** from the historical price data of the respective stock index, in our case the 'DAX'. The **beta coefficient** of the individual company is retrieved from the `FMP API` while we use `yahoo finance API` for **historical price data of the respective index**."

I checked the Notes of the AR and found that E.ON SE reported in its EBIT special items, i.e. a positive one-off effect, of +45 EURbn from derivative financial income, which does clearly not belong to the usual core business of E.ON SE! If we were to subtract this positive one-off earnings effect \"as-if\" it would have not incurred, focusing merely on the real operating activities, the EBIT in the Annual Report would not look as \"rosy\" as presented initially.\n",

    "For each individual position in our forecast model we need to calculate CAGRs which we then use in order to extrapolate each position into the future and to calculate the **unlevered Free-Cashflow-to-the-Firm** for each future year. For reasons of simplicity we do not average between a terminal Enterprise Value based on an EV/EBITDA multiple and a Terminal Value that is based on a perpetual growth rate - we simply use the method based on a perpetual growth rate. Maybe I will change this in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the `perpetual (long-term growth rate)` to calculate the **terminal value** I use a 'tunable' variable, called `g`, which simply is a adjusted WACC rate, i.e. the WACC is adjusted manually by a hypothetical number that allows to reach a 'reasonable' terminal value. If you would take the simple cagr of the revenue development over the last years, you would receive - in most cases - astronomical valuations (it escalates exponentially quite quickly!)\n",
    "\n",
    "- For 'EBIT' we use `operatingIncomeRatio` from the Income Statement as delivered by FMP and the related average over the last available years and apply it on the extrapolated revenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For 'Cash Taxes' in order to calculate `NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax)` we use the defined tax rate of _15%_ of the German Tax system\n",
    "\n",
    "- For 'D&A' we use `depreciationAndAmortization` as given in the Income Statement data of FMP, for 'Capex' we use `capitalExpenditure` and for 'Changes in Net Working Capital' we use `changeInWorkingCapital` from the CF Statement as delivered by FMP as a rough estimate. \n",

# ValuationModel_Python
This repository builds a corporate valuation model in Python with the `yahoo finance API`. In particular, a database in **PostgreSQL** is set up in order to build store fundamental financial data from the yahoo finance API. Finally, we calculate the enterprise value with the **DCF Method** and compare it with the current market value of the company in order to assess under- or overvaluation.
